Hello there, hope you have a great day.

These are the major design and architecture decisions I had to take while building this web application.


Choosing a Single Page Application (SPA) Framework:
React was the most loved web framework of 2019 according to stackoverflow survey. It has most questions, really good documentation and lots of support e.g components available.


Choosing a Programming Pattern:
React has several programming patterns and I chose to sepreate concerns in a container and a logic component.
Used Controlled Components.


Deployment:
This could be easily deployed on a cloud based IAAS (Infrastructure as a service) like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft Azure.


I wanted to add functionality of Upcoming events near me through google api but unfortunately I didnt get time.
Thank you KT.
